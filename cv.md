My name's Iana. I'm 20 yo. After two years of studying in me dream university I no longer wanted to be a teacher and left my University. I took a gap year to find myself a new hobby or a job and wasn't successful in it. So now I'm trying myself in IT hoping that it's something that i'll like 

## **Code example**

```
 const isPrime = (number) => {
  if (number < 2) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= number / 2; i += 1) {
    if (number % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```
